Exploring web automation, content systems, and performance-based publishing.

Hi, I’m building lean content systems that use automation, AI, and data-driven strategies to deliver high-impact content at scale. Focused on financial literacy, digital skills, and smart web tools — all powered by fast, static site delivery.

Projects here include:
- SEO-optimized microsites
- Hands-free blog generation workflows
- Pre-landers and opt-in funnels
- Content stacks targeting real-world problems
